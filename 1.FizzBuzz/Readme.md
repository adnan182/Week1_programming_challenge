# Challenge: FizzBuzz
## Objective: 
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to N (1 < N < 10000000). However, for multiples of three, print “Fizz” instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print “FizzBuzz”
  
## Instruction:
Create a loop that iterates from 1 to N.

For each iteration, check if the current number is divisible by 3, 5, or both.

Print “Fizz” for numbers divisible by 3, “Buzz” for numbers divisible by 5, and “FizzBuzz” for numbers divisible by both.

If the number is not divisible by either, just print the number itself.
