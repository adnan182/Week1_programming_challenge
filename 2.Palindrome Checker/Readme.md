# Challenge: Palindrome Checker
## Objective: 
Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).
  
## Instruction:
1. Prompt the user to enter a string.

2. Remove any non-alphanumeric characters and convert the string to lowercase.

3. Check if the cleaned string reads the same forward and backward.

4. Print “Palindrome” if it is, and “Not a palindrome” if it is not.

```
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"
